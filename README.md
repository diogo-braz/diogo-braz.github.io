## _`$ cat about_me.txt`_

I'm currently immersed in the world of software engineering, with a focus on delving into realms like reverse engineering, algorithm analysis, and cryptography. During my downtime, you'll find me at the gym, cruising on my motorcycle, and honing my skills in jiu-jitsu. Beyond that, my playlist is dominated by the sounds of rock and rap music.
