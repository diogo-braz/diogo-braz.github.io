## _`$ cat about_me.txt`_

I am currently studying computer science, I work in the development area but I want to migrate to the security area. I like to study reverse engineering, algorithm analysis and cryptography. In my spare time, I like to go to the gym, play basketball, and especially ride my motorcycle. Besides this, I like to listen mainly to rock and rap music.
